# Diplomski-Matrix_Eigenvalues_In_CUDA

## Introduction

This is a project that I have done in my university.

## Executing

To execute this program you need to install CUDA, CUDA Toolkit and lapack library.

To compile the program you need to install gcc

Use script for compiling "make"

Enviroment in which program was tested is Linux Ubuntu 20.04 

## Program

Implementation is used for computing matrix eigenvalues by Jacobi algorithm.

Computing is divided for serial and parallel version.
